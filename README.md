* # Overview
This repository contains source codes of our recent research work (DELVE: Deep Discriminative Representation Learning-based Long-tail Visual Detection of Benthonic Organisms), which exclusively solves challenges originated from long-tail distribution of benthonic organisms by innovatively devising discriminative additive angular margin-based classification loss and uneven embedding representation distribution loss. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons sufficiently demonstrate that the DELVE framework outperforms generic and long-tail detection approaches.
